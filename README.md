# Computer-Vision-Based-Vehicle-Detection-and-Classification-System-Using-Deep-Learning

This project aims to develop an automated vehicle detection and classification system based on Computer Vision and Deep Learning to identify various types of vehicles such as cars, motorcycles, buses, and trucks in real world traffic conditions. The development process includes dataset collection, manual object annotation, training a deep learning-based object detection model, and performance evaluation through testing on unseen data to ensure accuracy and reliability.
